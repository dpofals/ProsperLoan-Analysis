# ProsperLoan-Analysis
The goal of the analysis is to gain insights into the factors that affect loan performance and to identify any patterns or trends in the data.
The analysis was performed using Python and Jupyter Notebook. The following steps were taken:
Data Cleaning: The dataset was cleaned by dropping unnecessary columns, handling missing values, and correcting data types.
Data Exploration & Visualization: The dataset was explored and visualized using various charts such as bar charts, line charts, and scatter plots.
Statistical Analysis: Hypothesis testing was performed to determine if there were any significant differences in loan performance based on loan attributes such as loan amount and borrower credit score.
