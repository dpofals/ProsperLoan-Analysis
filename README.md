# ProsperLoan-Analysis
The goal of the analysis is to gain insights into the factors that affect loan performance and to identify any patterns or trends in the data.
The analysis was performed using Python and Jupyter Notebook. The following steps were taken:
Data Cleaning: The dataset was cleaned by dropping unnecessary columns, handling missing values, and correcting data types.
Data Exploration & Visualization: The dataset was explored and visualized using various charts such as bar charts, line charts, and scatter plots.
Statistical Analysis: Hypothesis testing was performed to determine if there were any significant differences in loan performance based on loan attributes such as loan amount and borrower credit score.

# Conclusion
During the data exploration, I analyzed the ProsperLoan dataset using Python and several data visualization techniques. The main feature of interest was the loan status, and my main goal was to identify factors that influenced loan performance, such as credit score, loan amount, and borrower's employment status. Some of the main findings of the data exploration were: Borrowers with higher credit scores tended to have lower default rates. Loans with higher interest rates had higher default rates. There was a positive correlation between loan amount and borrower income. Borrowers who were employed tended to have higher loan amounts than those who were not employed. Summarily, these findings suggest that a borrower's creditworthiness, income, and employment status, all play important roles in loan performance. Lenders should take note of these when considering loan applications and setting interest rates. The data exploration process involved several steps, including data cleaning, data visualization, and statistical analysis. I used Python and the Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn libraries to explore and visualize the data, and I made several important discoveries about the relationships between different features in the dataset. In conclusion, the data exploration process was an effective way to gain insights into the ProsperLoan dataset and identify factors responsible for loan performance.
